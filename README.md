# Integration of Generative AI for Prompt-Based Report Delivery in an Accounting Platform

## Project Overview

This project integrates Generative AI into an accounting platform to enable prompt-based report delivery. Users can generate customized reports using natural language queries. The system ensures data privacy and security, allowing users to access only their own data.

## Architecture Overview

### Components and Technologies

1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - **Frontend Framework:** React.js or Angular.js
   - **Description:** A web-based interface where users input their natural language queries and receive reports.

2. **Authentication Service**
   - **Framework:** Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT-based authentication
   - **Description:** Ensures secure authentication and authorization of users. Manages user sessions and tokens.

3. **API Gateway**
   - **Framework:** Flask
   - **Description:** Routes incoming requests to the appropriate backend services and ensures security and logging.

4. **Gen-AI Service**
   - **Framework:** Flask
   - **AI Model:** OpenAI GPT-4 or similar, integrated via API calls
   - **Description:** Processes natural language queries and generates report specifications.

5. **Report Service**
   - **Framework:** Flask
   - **Description:** Uses the specifications from the Gen-AI service to generate reports, accessing the appropriate data as needed.

6. **Data Service**
   - **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB
   - **ORM:** SQLAlchemy for PostgreSQL or PyMongo for MongoDB
   - **Description:** Handles data retrieval, ensuring that each user can only access their own data. Applies filters based on user identity and permissions.

7. **Logging and Monitoring Service**
   - **Tools:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus and Grafana
   - **Description:** Monitors system health and logs activities for audit and troubleshooting.

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - User logs in through the UI.
   - Authentication Service (Flask-JWT-Extended) verifies credentials and provides a secure token.
   - Token is used for subsequent API requests to ensure secure access.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - User submits a natural language query via the UI.
   - API Gateway routes the query to the Gen-AI Service.
   - Gen-AI Service processes the query and generates a report specification.

3. **Report Generation:**
   - Gen-AI Service sends the report specification to the Report Service.
   - Report Service requests the necessary data from the Data Service.
   - Data Service applies filters to ensure data privacy and retrieves the relevant data.
   - Report Service compiles the report and returns it to the user via the API Gateway and UI.

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Use Flask-JWT-Extended for secure user authentication.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access.

2. **Data Privacy:**
   - Ensure all data queries are filtered based on user identity.
   - Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest.

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

4. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Log all access and modification attempts.
   - Monitor for unusual activity and alert administrators as needed.

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests:**
   - Test individual components (e.g., authentication, data retrieval) for expected functionality.

2. **Integration Tests:**
   - Ensure that components interact correctly (e.g., authentication service correctly restricts data access).

3. **End-to-End Tests:**
   - Simulate user behavior to test the complete flow from login to report generation.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Test how the system handles invalid inputs, unauthorized access attempts, and other edge cases.
